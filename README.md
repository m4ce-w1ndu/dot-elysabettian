# Elysabettian JIT / Virtual Machine written using the C# language

## 1. Introduction
**Elysabettian** is a personal project intended as a way to learn how to make a **programming language** from scratch. This is, obviously, an idea that can be applied whenever you need to learn a new programming language. And that is exactly what I am doing. The original version of the **Elysabettian**, known by our "team" as the *reference implementation* is a C++ project living in a GitHub repository that you can find over at [elysabettian](https://github.com/m4ce-w1ndu/elysabettian) and it is the most complete and thoroughly tested implementation of the language.  
In my path to **perfecting** my knowledge of the **C# Programming Language** I decided to provide a functionally equivalent version of the language written in **C# .NET 6.0**.

## 2. What to expect
If you follow closely the development process, the **early versions** will be certainly plagued with bugs, as it is not so straightforward to port a project this complex from **a language such as C#** to any managed language, even if the **C# Language** inherits much of the programming characteristics and basic syntax from **C++**.
